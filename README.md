# Entry-level Python workshops
Note that most of the materials is in Polish.

First few notebooks cover:
* loops, conditional expressions
* data structures (lists, dictionaries)
* simple algorithms (finding minimum in a list, binary search, counting sort)
* recursive functions
* time complexity

Latter focus on the main goal of the workshop: creating a program, which will be competing in a toy online multiplayer game: https://github.com/pierewoj/snake
